Description: SelfControlledCaseSeries is an R package for performing self-
    controlled case series (SCCS) analyses in an observational database in the OMOP
    Common Data Model. It extracts all necessary data from the database and 
    transforms it to the format required for SCCS. Age and season can be modeled
    using splines assuming constant hazard within calendar months. Event-dependent 
    censoring of the observation period can be corrected for. Many exposures can be
    included at once (MSCCS), with regularization on all coefficients except for the
    exposure of interest.
