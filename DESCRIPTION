Description: SelfControlledCaseSeries is an R package for performing self-
	controlled case series (SCCS) analyses in an observational database in the OMOP
	Common Data Model. It extracts all necessary data from the database and 
	transforms it to the format required for SCCS. Age and season can be modeled
	using splines assuming constant hazard within calendar months. Event-dependent 
	censoring of the observation period can be corrected for. Many exposures can be
	included at once (MSCCS), with regularization on all coefficients except for the
	exposure of interest.
