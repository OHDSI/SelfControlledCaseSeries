\arguments{
\item{sccsData}{An object of type \link{SccsData} as created using the
\link{getDbSccsData} function.}

\item{studyPopulation}{An object created using the \code{\link[=createStudyPopulation]{createStudyPopulation()}} function.}

\item{exposureEraId}{The exposure to create the era data for. If not specified it is
assumed to be the one exposure for which the data was loaded from
the database.}
